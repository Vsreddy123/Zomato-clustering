Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, particularly clustering, we will segment restaurants based on their characteristics (e.g., cost, cuisine, collections) and customer reviews. Sentiment analysis will be applied to customer reviews to understand public perception and identify key aspects influencing ratings. The analysis will provide actionable insights for both Zomato (to identify areas for growth and improvement) and customers (to find the best restaurants tailored to their preferences). The project leverages Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, NumPy for efficient operations, and Scikit-learn for model building. We will focus on understanding variables, cleaning data, feature engineering, and visualizing relationships to uncover meaningful patterns and support business decisions."

        "    * The `Timings` column has 1 missing value.\n",
        "* **Data Type Issues:** The `Cost` column, which represents the estimated cost of dining per person, is an `object` type. It will need to be converted to a numeric type for calculations and might contain non-numeric characters like commas (e.g., '1,300') that require cleaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Zomato Restaurant Reviews (`restaurant_reviews_df`)**\n",
        "* This dataset contains 10,000 customer reviews.\n",

        "* The `Pictures` column is of `int64` type, while others are `object` type.\n",

        "* **Data Type Issues:**\n",
        "    * The `Rating` column is `object` type but represents numerical ratings. It needs to be converted to a numeric type. It's crucial to check if there are any non-numeric entries like 'Like' or 'Love' as sometimes seen in review datasets, which would require specific handling.\n",
        "    * The `Metadata` column contains combined text (e.g., \"3 Reviews, 2 Followers\") and will require parsing to extract the number of reviews and followers as separate numerical features.\n",
        "    * The `Time` column is an `object` type and needs to be converted to a proper datetime format for time-series analysis or understanding review trends.\n",

        "Positive Business Impact: Zomato can leverage this information for targeted promotions and marketing campaigns. For instance, running ads or special offers on Thursdays or Fridays to encourage weekend dining and review posting could be highly effective. Restaurants can also staff more appropriately for higher weekend demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Potential Negative Growth Insights: If the dip in weekday reviews also correlates with lower business for restaurants, it suggests a need for strategies to boost weekday engagement. Zomato could explore incentives for dining/ordering on weekdays to balance out traffic, preventing potential restaurant revenue dips during off-peak days."

        "\n",
        "Manual One-Hot Encoding for Multi-value Features (Cuisines, Collections): For columns where a single entry could contain multiple categories (e.g., \"North Indian, Chinese\"), we first split the string into individual categories. Then, for each unique individual category (e.g., 'North Indian'), a new binary column was created. A '1' indicates the presence of that cuisine/collection for a given restaurant, and '0' indicates its absence.\n",

        "Reason:\n",
        "\n",
        "Avoids Ordinality: One-Hot Encoding converts categorical variables into a numerical format without implying any order or ranking between the categories. This is crucial for nominal categorical variables (like cuisine types or collection names) where an artificial order created by Label Encoding could mislead machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suitable for Clustering: Many clustering algorithms (like K-Means) rely on distance calculations. One-hot encoding ensures that each category is treated as equally distant from others, preventing misinterpretations of relationships between categories.\n",

        "K-Means is a prominent unsupervised machine learning algorithm designed to partition 'n' observations into 'k' distinct clusters. Its fundamental principle is to assign each data point to the cluster whose centroid (mean) is nearest. This centroid acts as a representative prototype for its cluster. The algorithm iteratively refines these assignments and centroid positions: it starts by randomly selecting 'k' initial centroids, then repeatedly assigns data points to their closest centroid and recalculates the centroids based on the newly formed clusters. This process continues until convergence, where centroid positions no longer change significantly. The algorithm's objective is to minimize the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS), also known as inertia, which quantifies the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned cluster's centroid. A lower WCSS generally implies more compact and well-defined clusters.\n",

        "Performance using Evaluation Metric Score Chart:\n",

        "\n",
        "Visualization: The \"Elbow Method for Optimal K\" chart plots the WCSS against a range of possible 'K' values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpretation: As 'K' increases, WCSS inherently decreases because each data point is closer to its own cluster's centroid when there are more clusters. The \"elbow point\" on this graph is the 'K' value where the rate of decrease in WCSS sharply diminishes. This point is considered the optimal 'K' as it offers a good balance between minimizing within-cluster variance and avoiding excessive numbers of clusters.\n",

        "Why K-Means?:\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpretability of Clusters: K-Means produces centroid-based clusters. The centroids represent the mean of all data points in that cluster. This makes cluster characterization straightforward and intuitive; we can inspect the average values of the original features for each cluster's centroid to understand what defines that segment (e.g., \"Cluster 1: High-Cost, Fine-Dining, High Average Rating\"). This ease of interpretation is crucial for deriving actionable business insights.\n",
        "\n",

        "Balance of Compactness and Separation: K-Means aims to minimize WCSS, leading to relatively compact clusters. When combined with a good Silhouette Score, it ensures both internal homogeneity and external separation.\n",
        "\n",
        "DBSCAN Limitations: While DBSCAN is good for arbitrary shapes and outlier detection, it can be sensitive to parameter tuning and may produce many noise points or a single large cluster if densities vary significantly, sometimes making it less ideal for a fixed number of business segments.\n",

        "\n",
        "Our initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed key characteristics of the datasets. We found that restaurant ratings on Zomato are heavily skewed towards higher scores, with a pronounced peak at 5-star ratings, suggesting overall customer satisfaction but also potential challenges in fine-grained differentiation among highly-rated establishments. North Indian and Chinese cuisines emerged as overwhelmingly the most common offerings, highlighting popular culinary trends but also areas of high competition. Analysis of review timestamps showed a concentration of reviews in May 2019, indicating a limited time scope of the provided data rather than seasonal trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering phase was crucial in preparing the raw data. We meticulously handled missing values by imputation (e.g., 'Unknown Collection' for missing categories, median for numerical ratings) and strategic dropping of incomplete records (e.g., missing review text) to ensure data integrity. Key numerical features like Cost and Rating were converted to appropriate data types. Crucially, we engineered new features by parsing reviewer Metadata into Reviews_Count and Followers_Count, and by applying extensive text preprocessing to the Review text. This included steps like contraction expansion, lowercasing, punctuation and URL removal, stopword removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization to transform text into numerical features for machine learning. We also derived a sentiment_score for each review using NLTK's VADER, adding a vital dimension of customer perception. Log transformations were applied to skewed count-based features, and numerical features were Standard Scaled to prepare the data for distance-based clustering algorithms. Finally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, which was essential given the high number of features generated by one-hot encoding cuisines and collections, mitigating the curse of dimensionality and improving model efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the ML Model Implementation, we focused on unsupervised clustering to segment restaurants. While Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN were explored, K-Means Clustering was chosen as the final model due to its interpretability, scalability, and the clarity provided by the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score for optimal K selection. By analyzing the mean values of original features within each cluster, we can characterize distinct restaurant segments (e.g., \"Budget-Friendly Multi-Cuisine,\" \"Premium Fine-Dining,\" \"Niche Lower-Engagement,\" \"Established Top-Rated Hybrid\"). This segmentation is a core deliverable, providing a data-driven categorization of Zomato's restaurant ecosystem.\n",
